#In Progress

#Purpose
This code will provide a linux command line tool used to generate data structures in the C language along with algorithms for traversing and sorting.
Since there is not common, C data structure library and most people usually end up programming their own, this tool will generate dynamic data structures specific to the users purposes depending on the command line arguments that will be passed in to the tool.

##Data Structures
Stack, SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, Queue, Red Black Tree
B-Tree, Hash Map, Heap

##Sorting Algorithms
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort

##Tree Traversal Algorithms
Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
